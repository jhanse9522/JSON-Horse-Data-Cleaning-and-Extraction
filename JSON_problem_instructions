Attached is a py file and a json file.

Download both into a new folder within pycharm.

Work through the py file, adding code under each prompt.  You'll be editing this py file directly.

Add your name somewhere in the PY file!

Submit your edited py file, data output files, and your narrative file.  You'll only have the one PY file to submit.

Narratives are expected for coding problems 2, 3, and 4 and are noted in the file. Don't forget the short weekly reflection! (2-3 sentences)

The problems within this file are:

2&4 CR students

Discussion problem 1
Coding problem 1
Coding problem 2
Coding problem 3
4CR students:

Discussion problem 2 (this item appears within the 2CR section)
